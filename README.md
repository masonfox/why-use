### Livereload
Making sass, css, js, and html changes initializes the browser at 'localhost:3000' to refresh automatically. Make sure you have the livereload browser plugin installed.

#### How to start rails server and guard:

Run the following command in one terminal tab:
`$ rails s`

Followed by opening another and typing:
`$ bundle exec guard`

Navigate to 'localhost:3000' and turn on the livereload plugin and you are good.
